# Getting Started with Other Languages

gRPC is available for [a multitude of languages](https://grpc.io/docs/quickstart/).

You can easily call the GraphQL endpoint with those languages after issuing a fresh JWT from our [authentication endpoint](#authentication).

See the [Protobuf service definition](https://github.com/dfuse-io/graphql-over-grpc/blob/master/graphql/graphql.proto), and the [GraphQL docs](#graphql) to get the action going.
