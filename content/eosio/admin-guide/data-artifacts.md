Goal: understand all the data consumed and produced by dfuse, the different databases, the different types of storages.

* nodeos blocks.log
* nodeos state
* nodeos portable state snapshots (links)
* dfuse one-block files
* dfuse merged blocks files (100-blocks files)
* dfuse search indexes (bleve indexes)
* dfuse database: fluxdb
* dfuse database: trxdb (where transactions and blocks can be split)
