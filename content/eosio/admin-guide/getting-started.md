{{< alert type="note" >}}
The **goal of this page** is to get you off the ground, and launch `dfuseeos` on your local machine.
{{< /alert >}}

## Your first run

The simplest way to start, is to follow the
[installation]({{< ref "./installation" >}}) instructions to install `nodeos` and
get the `dfuseeos` binary, followed by the simple
[local laptop-style method]({{< ref "./local-instance" >}}) to boot `dfuseeos`.
