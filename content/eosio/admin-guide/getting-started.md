Goal: get off the ground, and launch `dfuseeos` on your local machine.

## Your first run

The simplest way to start, is to follow the
[installation](./installation) instructions to install `nodeos` and
get the `dfuseeos` binary, followed by the simple
[local laptop-style method](./local-instance) to boot `dfuseeos`.
