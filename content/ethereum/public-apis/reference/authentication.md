## Authentication for Ethereum

There is nothing specific to Ethereum for authentication. If you're working with the dfuse cloud service, take a look at
the [Authentication](/platform/dfuse-cloud/authentication/) page in the [dfuse Platform &mdash; dfuse Cloud](/platform/dfuse-cloud/)
section for more information about authenticating with dfuse.
