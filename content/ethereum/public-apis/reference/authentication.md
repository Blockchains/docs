There is nothing specific about Ethereum regarding authentication.

If you're working with the _dfuse Cloud_ service, take a look at
the [Authentication](/platform/dfuse-cloud/authentication/) page in the [dfuse Platform &mdash; dfuse Cloud](/platform/dfuse-cloud/)
section for more information about authenticating with dfuse.
